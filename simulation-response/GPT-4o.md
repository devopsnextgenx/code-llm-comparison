<task>
Throw a ball with such a speed and angle to get range of 70m and height 40m, adjust speed and angle according to returned response range distance and height of called function, call mcp tool max 5 times or less and give best possible option as response, if achived response within +/-0.5m for both range distance and height consider it as best, also predict possible g value you can understand from retrieved throw data (Assumtion for throwing ball on earth might not be valid, as you dont know what planet you are on)
Final response should be as below, in json:
- Speed
- Angle
- calculated possible value of g from previous throw data
- Model (LLM model version and name. Yourself)

[ERROR] You did not use a tool in your previous response! Please retry with a tool use.

# Reminder: Instructions for Tool Use

Tool uses are formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:

<tool_name>
<parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
<parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
...
</tool_name>

For example:

<attempt_completion>
<result>
I have completed the task...
</result>
</attempt_completion>

Always adhere to this format for all tool uses to ensure proper parsing and execution.

# Next Steps

If you have completed the user's task, use the attempt_completion tool. 
If you require additional information from the user, use the ask_followup_question tool. 
Otherwise, if you have not completed the task and do not need additional information, then proceed with the next step of the task. 
(This is an automated message, so do not respond to it conversationally.)
